It is incomplete and subject to change.  We've made it available early in the spirit of transparency to receive early community feedback.  Please create [issues](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues) with your feedback._\r\n\r\n_In particular, the definition of materials are in flux, and work on animations and texture and geometry compression are still in the early stages.  We are also initially focusing on WebGL.  OpenGL ES and OpenGL need additional considerations._\r\n\r\n## Converter\r\n\r\nA [converter](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/wiki/converter) can be used to produce glTF assets out of COLLADA.\r\n\r\n## Viewer\r\n\r\nGLTF Viewer based on [montagejs](https://github.com/montagejs/montage) can be found [here](https://github.com/fabrobinet/glTF-webgl-viewer)\r\n\r\n#### Workflow\r\n\r\nthis project provides a reliable toolchain based on OpenCOLLADA.\r\nStarting from exporter plugins in major authoring tools to COLLADA parsing when converting to JSON, \r\nOpenCOLLADA is where all efforts to import/export COLLADA files are centralized.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
